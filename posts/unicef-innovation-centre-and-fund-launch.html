<p>The raw-but-full transcript from my recent visit to the United Nations for
the Launch of the UN Innovation Centre &amp; Fund can be found in my <a
target="_blank" href="http://github.com/decause/raw">decause/raw</a> repo
on GitHub, but here are a few choice quotes, and a rough word_cloud mask.</p>


<blockquote>When I first started 16 years ago, I asked one of my colleagues,
how does it work? Innovate, Demonstrate, replicate, advocate. I've followed
that ever since. You can't do it just once, you gotta do it all the
time.<br/>David Morely, President &amp; CEO, UNICEF Canada</blockquote> 

<blockquote>"If you give voice to the common people, they will share their
ideas generally. Much more knowledge exists in Open Source... Children are
not a sink of resources, but a source of innovation.<br/>~Prof. Anil Gupta,
Founder of Honeybee Network</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is a saying that You can count the seeds in an apple, but you
cannot count the apples in a seed. We're hoping to build tens of millions of
apples in the future.<br/>~Ambassador HAHN Choong-hee, Deputy Permanent
Representative of the Republic of Korea to the UN in New York.</blockquote>
