<p>Hi There! It has been a busy couple of weeks! Thankfully I'm done travelling for a little while (and hopefully done with RedEye flights forever too... /me is getting too old for that bizz)</p>

<h2>RelEngFAD</h2>
<p>The Fedora Release Engineering FAD (RelEngFAD) gathered 15+ contributors from across a number of projects and teams to discuss the future of "shipping bits to users." As I am still new to this side of the project, I was able to learn more about how this ecosystem operates over those five <strong>days</strong>, than I had osmosed over the past five <strong>years.</strong></p>

<p>I've got a bunch of inbox and administrivia to catch up on for now, so stay tuned for more granular updates to come!</p>
