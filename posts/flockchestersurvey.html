It's finally done, and I've half-way caught up on all the sleep I didn't get during the past week ;) I had a ball seeing all you Fedorans strolling around my regular haunts, and cannot wait to see you all again soon. May your travels home be safe and expedient!</p>

<p>Please be patient with me for the next day or so as catch up on my inbox and all the administrivia and loop-closing that comes along with hosting a conference in your hometown. Once that is taken care of, I'll be spinning up a proper recap and redux blog post for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flocktofedora.org">FLOCK 2015</a> (aka FLOCKchester).

While we wait for that, if you did attend the conference this year, you should <a target="_blank" href="
