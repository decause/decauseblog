<p>Since I got here, I've been doing my best to create a mental map of all the
<em>parts</em> of Fedora. From what I've gathered thusfar, there are <a
target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview">13</a>
subprojects (See: wiki sidebar), along with a number of web properties, and a
slew of upstream communities that Fedorans are tapped into. But even after
getting the broadest sense of how many moving parts there are, that still
doesn't explain <em>HOW</em>, only who.</em> I've said to myself "Gee whiz, if
only there were a list of all the things that needed to be done to ship a
release..." Today, thanks to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jzb">jzb</a>, I have found the
<strong>HOLY GRAIL</strong> of "how a Fedora becomes a release" and I'm here to
share it with you too!</p>
