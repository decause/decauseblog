After upgrading to <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora22</a> last week, I've had to sand down a few rough corners. One of them which has cropped up was that some of the tracks on <a target="_blank" href="http://soundcloud.com">Soundcloud</a> just would not play while I was in <a target="_blank" href="https://mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a>. I thought it was likely because user-generated content is often prone to take-downs, spurious or not, and just kinda shrugged it off. But after trying to play a few particularly popular tracks from confirmed accounts, I decided something must be amiss. I popped open the code inspector, enabled the console, and right off the bat was greeted with a clever recruiting message from Soundcloud:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "You like to look under the hood? Why not help us build the engine? http://soundcloud.com/jobs"
</blockquote>

<p>Thereafter, I would get <code>"Media resource could not be decoded"</code> error messages followed by long strings representing the tracks.</p>

<p>
Through some search-engine-foo, I was able to dig up this ticket: <a
target="_blank"
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=964032">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=964032</a>.
In it, it is explained that there was likely an issue with codecs not being
installed, with Ubuntu specific instructions. After originally enabling the RPM
Fusion repos, I was able to search for and install
<code>gstreamer1-libav</code> codec, restart Firefox, and play the broken tracks.
