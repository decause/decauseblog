<p>
It has been a more-busy-than-usual week on campus, and I've had a pretty packed conference schedule. I've been much too far behind on New Year's Resolution:

Ship Copy.

<p>
So, in it's most-purest most-rawest most-honest form, you can find a number of raw transcripts in the new  repo: <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/decause/raw"><strong>decause/raw</strong></a></p>

<p>
So, What does <em>that</em> look like?

<p>18,529 words, or, just over 41 pages total of raw text.</p>

<p>There is a flaw in my workflow. Though there is some utility in a raw transcript, really it is mostly when delivered in real-time. After the fact, there is much post-production work to be done, like spell checking. Even after, if there is a video, then the transcript is partial, and incomplete. This is bothersome to many potential downstream consumers of raw text. So where does that leave us?</p>

<h2>Word Clouds</h2>

<p>I've played with <code>word_cloud</code> before within my <a target="_blank"
href="http://github.com/decause/presinaug">decause/presignaug</a> for building
presidential inauguration visualizations last year. Since then, word_cloud has
gotten <strong>much</strong> more sophisticated--now using scikitlearn, and numpy, and providing the ability to fit word clouds within images!</p>

<h3>List of Issues/Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>you'll need to <code>pip install cython</code> first</li>
    <li><strike>You'll need to <code>sudo yum install freetype-devel</code> (probably not necessary, since this is alleviated by pointing at a diff <code>.ttf</code> typeface...)</strike></li>
    <li>you'll have to edit your <code>FONT_PATH</code> within word_cloud.py</li>
    <li>image masks *must* be saved as greyscale, not rgb images (this was a biggie, and I wouldn't have figured it out if <code>GIMP</code> didn't display the color encoding in the file statusbar when you opened things :) )</li>
</ul>

I went ahead and uploaded the changes I made to my fork on GitHub: <a target="_blank"
    href="http://github.com/decause/word_cloud">http://github.com/decause/word_cloud</a> if you'd like to see them. The important files are <code>pycon.py</code> and <code>pycon-greys.py</code>.
